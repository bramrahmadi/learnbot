## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### For Better Job Matches

1. **Be specific with skill names** — Use "React" not "React.js" or "ReactJS"
2. **Set accurate proficiency levels** — Honest self-assessment leads to better matches
3. **Keep your profile updated** — Add new skills as you learn them
4. **Toggle "Open to Work"** — This enables job matching recommendations
5. **Complete your profile** — Higher completeness = better recommendations

### For Better Resume Parsing

1. **Use a clean, single-column layout** — Avoid complex formatting
2. **Use standard section headings** — "Experience", "Education", "Skills"
3. **Avoid tables and text boxes** — These confuse the parser
4. **Use text-based PDFs** — Scanned images cannot be parsed
5. **List skills explicitly** — Have a dedicated "Skills" section

### For Effective Learning

1. **Focus on critical gaps first** — These have the highest impact on your score
2. **Set a weekly learning schedule** — Consistency beats intensity
3. **Choose hands-on resources** — Practice reinforces learning
4. **Get certificates when possible** — They validate your skills to employers
5. **Update your profile after learning** — Keep your skill levels current
